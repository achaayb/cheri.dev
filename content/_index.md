Hi, I'm Ali. a self-taught Backend/DevOps engineer with experience in cybersecurity I've designed complex solutions in partnership with multiple businesses. My main language is Python, however I'm not very interested in working on typical CRUD applications. I do best in demanding situations that force me to step outside of my comfort zone.
